 * data analytics
 * - the process of analyzing data to derive useful information and valuable insights
 * 
 * serveral key types of data analysis
 * - descriptive data analysis: presents data in a descriptive format
 * - exploratory data analysis: is used to establish a relationship between different variables
 * - inferential data analysis: focuses on a small sample of data to make inferences
 * - predictive data analysis: identifies patterns and data to make predictions about future performance
 * - causal data analysis: explores cause and effect between variables
 * 
 * kind of measurements
 * - quantitative
 *     + refers to numerical data
 *     + data that can be counted or quantified
 *     + EX:
 *         . average number of customers who make purchases each day
 *         . average cost of each purchase made
 * - qualitative
 *     + refers to non-numerical data
 *     + textual and descriptive data
 *     + EX: category names or description of products like furniture of office supplies
 * 
 * four different measurement scales
 * - nominal scale (qualitative)
 *     + describes the identity property of non-numerical data
 *     + EX:
 *         . identify products in their stock like a chair or a desk
 *         . each product is one nominal unit of data
 * 
 * - ordinal (order) scale (qualitative)
 *     + places data in a specific ranked order
 *     +  it doesn't include decisive criteria to determine the difference between the data elements
 *     + EX:
 *         . rank chairs using ratings values
 *         . top quality product (1st), very good product (2nd), good product (3rd)
 *         . no precise criteria that determines the measurement between each value
 * - interval scale
 *     + includes properties of the nominal and ordinal scales. 
 *     + identifies the differences between data points
 *     + can also contain both positive, negative numbers, and zero
 *     + EX: can use the interval scale to provide feedback on products from 10 to -10
 * - ratio scale (quantitative)
 *     + includes properties from nominal, ordinal, and interval scale
 *     + it defines the identity of the data classifies the data in order and marks clear intervals
 *     + it holds an absolute value of zero
 *     + EX: can use the ratio scale to mark the weight of products
